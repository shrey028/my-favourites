    <h2>Genesis G80</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      My favourite car is the Genesis G80. The exterior is sleak, whereas the
      interior is too futuristic for its generation. I see this car as a
      footstep to the future, which is why I am so invested in its looks. To me,
      this car is simple but sophisticated at the same time which is why I want
      it in the future. The reason why this car is my favourite is because of
      its simplicity, potential, and its unique interior.

    <h2>Pizza</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      My favourite dish is pizza. A spontaneous Italian delicacy, generations
      old. Pizza is a delcious dish with the perfect balance between a fluffy
      crust, tangy sauce, and a lavish helping of some mozzerella cheese. As a
      kid, I have always loved pizza which is why it is still my favourite dish.
      The memories I have with this are unfathomable, that I will always
      respect. The perfect twist between three main ingredients makes this dish
      a tasty delicacy, memorable dish, and a popular choice of favourites.

    <h2>The Office</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      My favourite TV show is The Office. This sitcom embarks on a journey of
      hillarious jokes, iconic comedy dialogue, and a relaxing environment.
      Being the first show I watched, I was hooked all through the 9 seasons of
      comedy. This show is heard about worldwide, by the iconic characters and
      humour. A subtle sitcom, but a chaotic masterpiece.
